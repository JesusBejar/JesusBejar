👨🏻‍💻  About Me
💡  I like to explore new technologies and develop software solutions and quick hacks.
🎓  I'm currently studying Software Development at the Brigham Young University - Idaho.
🌱  I'm on track for learning more about MERN fullstack development and .NET fullstack development.
✍️  In my free time, I read books on philosophy and exercise.
✉️  You can shoot me an email at israelbejarii@gmail.com! I'll try to respond as soon as I can.
